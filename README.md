## 🛠️ About Me

- 👨‍💻 **Cloud Security Architect** working at scale — driving security architecture across AWS and Azure for high-growth enterprises.
- ⚙️ **Automation-first mindset** — from JIT access flows to compliance dashboards, I believe in solving security problems *once* with smart automation.
- 🚀 **Worked on projects spanning**: IAM automation, SCIM integrations, JIT RBAC, AWS Trusted Advisor ingestion, OpsCenter pipelines, and security visibility dashboards.
- 🔐 **Built & deployed:** Security tooling across enterprise accounts with real-time SLA, incident aging, and risk visualization layers.
- 🌍 **Enterprise Work:** Major contributions at **Sixt** — focused on building scalable, secure-by-default cloud foundations and automations that span hundreds of AWS accounts.
- 🌱 **Currently exploring:** Policy-as-code at org scale, event-driven remediation pipelines, and eBPF security observability.
